# LiteCPU
A simple 6502 emulator based on [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/6502) 6502 computer project.

The aim of this project is to be able to run Ben Eater binaries on a simple emulator. 

This does not aims to be a perfect emulator for a 6502 CPU (and I do not expect to support all OPCODES) from it.
